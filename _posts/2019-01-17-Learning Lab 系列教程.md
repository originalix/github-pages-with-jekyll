Activity: Add some content to your blog
On the "Code" tab, select your originalix-patch-1 branch

Click Create new file

Name the file _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md, but replace the YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, and title with the title you'd like to use for your first blog post

If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "Page build failed: Invalid post date".
Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later
